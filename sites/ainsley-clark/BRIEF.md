## Bio

Most of my time is spent writing Go at Just Eat Takeaway.com, where I work as a Senior/Lead Software Engineer across platform services, architecture, and tooling. The rest goes into the thing I care about just as much — growing engineers and the Go community.

At JET, that meant founding and chairing the Go Guild, a cross-organisation community focused on Go adoption, engineering standards, and knowledge sharing. We've published over 10 episodes on YouTube, hosted speakers like Eleanor McHugh, and built a space where Gophers across the company come together to learn and set the bar higher.

In 2025, I spoke at GopherCon UK on how Just Eat uses tooling to deploy Go micro-services in minutes. Before that, I presented at JET TechFest and started creating content around Go best practices — from writing well-crafted packages to effective error handling.

Before JET, I spent four years at Reddico as a Senior Full Stack Engineer, designing and shipping an intelligent link-building tool that processed 100k+ tasks daily across ten bespoke micro-services. I also founded ainsley.dev, a registered software company that won Website of the Year in its first year — end-to-end experience from branding and design through to architecture and deployment.

Open source is a big part of how I contribute back. go-mail (190+ stars) is a cross-platform mail driver for Go. Verbis is a CMS built entirely in Go. WebKit turns a single app.json manifest into production-ready infrastructure and CI/CD pipelines.

The thread through all of it — whether it's code review, pair programming, one-on-ones, or running a guild — is making the engineers around me better and building communities where people actually grow.
