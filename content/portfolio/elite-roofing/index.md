<!-- Intro -->

Elite Roofing Services is a family run business that undertakes all aspects of domestic and industrial roofing from
changing a single tile to a full re-roof. They pride themselves on providing the best quality workmanship at competitive

As Elite Roofing were attracting their clientele
through [checkatrade.com](https://www.checkatrade.com/trades/eliteroofingservicesessex) they needed a website to boost
enquiries and showcase their excellent reviews and services. A landing page was to be created highlighting their
extensive experience in the industry with an easy way for potential customers to get in touch.

As there were no existing brand guidelines for Elite Roofing, a modern and striking colour palette was curated in
conjunction with a simple, yet, clean font. The electric red against the dark background helped to highlight important
content. A 3D roof model was created in [Spline](https://spline.design/), which brought the minimalist page to life and
captured the attention of potential clientele.

A custom CMS was used as a content management system, allowing Elite Roofing to
change content on their new site. Image sequencing was implemented in mobile, tablet and desktop viewports which allowed
for the 3D roof model to construct itself when the user scrolled down the page. This added a tremendous amount of depth
and quality to the landing page. Touches of animation using AOS and custom scroll sequences were added to bring the page
to life and add a sense of movement to the new website.
