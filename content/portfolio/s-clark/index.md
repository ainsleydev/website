With no existing website, Stephanie obtained all of her existing clients through word of mouth, but she wanted a brand
that packed a punch. ainsley.dev was tasked with creating a modern, sleek landing page that would appeal not only to the
students she teaches, but potential businesses seeking content writing. She wanted to convey English as her main staple
with over 20 years of experience in the field.

<!-- Design -->
{{< vertical-section text="Design" number="02" >}}
Soft multi-coloured gradients were used throughout the design, which helped to re-enforce a fun but interesting look. 3D
icons and a geometric grid were used for illustrations to give the page depth and a unique spin on iconography. The
scrabble illustration in the hero was meticulously designed to convey language as a key service. As a result, the
combination of the soft colour palette, geometric shapes and crisp typography created a sleek and professional site.

[Payload CMS](https://payloadcms.com) was used as a headless content management system, allowing Stephanie to chop and
change blocks and add new design elements as she needed. GoLang with [Webkit](https://github.com/ainsleydev/webkit) (a
custom web framework built by ainsley.dev) ensured for an extremely swift and rapid platform, achieving 100 points on
Page Speed Insights (desktop). [Motion](https://motion.dev/) was used to create the fluid scrabble animation in the
hero.
