### What is web development?

Web development is the process of creating, building and maintaining web applications that run online in a browser. It
differs from web design, however, in that it primarily encompasses tech and programming as opposed to
graphics, [branding](http:///services/branding/) and page layout.

### The importance of web development

Without web development, websites would merely be static pages without any functionality or interactivity, limiting
their usefulness and effectiveness in today's digital world. The tech or programming side of the web development process
is essential, as it translates the design concepts into functional websites or applications. Through coding in the
languages below, developers are able to create the structure and layout of web pages.

### The triad of web development

Even though the internet has come a long way from the early days of websites, three foundational technologies still
remain, forming the cornerstone of the modern web experience:

- **HTML -** - HyperText Markup Language serves as the structural foundation of web pages. It defines the skeleton in
  which websites are built. It is the primary language where content is authored, shaping the web page layout. HTML is
  written using semantic tags, such as `<div>` , `<header>` and `<footer>` These tags help the browser display the
  content.
- **CSS** - Cascading Style Sheets is used to bring style and presentation to a web page. Without CSS, websites would
  look like they're stuck in the 90s. It allows developers to define the visual appearance of HTML elements by
  manipulating their style, colour and spacing. Responsive web design also leverages CSS media queries to adapt the
  layout of a website based on the user's screen size.
- **JavaScript** - This is a versatile, dynamic programming language that brings interactivity and dynamism to webpages.
  It allows developers to create animations and effects and manipulate the browser to enhance user experience. When used
  correctly, JavaScript can modernise web applications and create truly unique web experiences.

### Does web development affect SEO?

To put it bluntly, yes. Web development plays a significant role in Search Engine Optimisation (SEO). Your site's SEO
relies heavily on the developer or agency who is creating it, so they go hand-in-hand.

Poor technical decisions that are made during the web development lifecycle can not only lower your rankings in search
engines, but can also effect your business' bottom line. Ranking factors such as page speed, mobile-friendless and the
use of clean, semantic HTML can all influence how your website is crawled and how high it ranks.

Investing in an agency like [ainsley.dev](http://ainsley.dev) that specialises in SEO can positively impact your
business' overall online visibility.
