faqs:
  - question: Do I need a CMS?
    answer: Deciding whether a CMS is the right choice for you depends on various factors. For many small businesses that are just getting started, sometimes a static site is enough. However, if you envisage adding content as your business expands, a CMS is certainly a good choice to grow your online presence.
  - question: Can you help me migrate my existing website?
    answer: Absolutely. We can migrate any platform you are using at the moment to your new CMS.
  - question: What's your CMS of choice?
    answer: Our primary stack of choice is PayloadCMS combined with GoLang. Payload is a versatile platform that allows for a vast array of customisation including custom fields, relationships, lifecycle hooks and components, to name a few. GoLang provides unmatched performance in scalability for web applications. With this stack, we ensure that your CMS build is optimised for speed, security and future growth.
  - question: How can I make changes to pages?
    answer: We make the customisation of pages extremely easy. Each page is tailored to the design, granting you the freedom to edit every aspect of your website content without worrying about altering the layout. Whether you need to update text, images or any other elements, you're able to do so with ease and without navigating a unnecessarily complex dashboard.
  - question: Can I add new pages?
    answer: Yes. We usually build the CMS using Dynamic Blocks so you're able to add in pages yourself without developer intervention. Each block can represent various elements such as text, contact forms or marketing sections, offering you flexibility to expand your website as you see fit.
  - question: Can you integrate our CRM system with the CMS?
    answer: Yes. We provide custom integration into any CRM. Whether you're using SalesForce, HubSpot or anything else, we can ensure the data synchronisation between your CMS & CRM is reliable and efficient.
  - question: Is training provided on how to use the CMS?
    answer: As part of our service, we provide comprehensive training sessions to familiarise you with the CMS. These sessions are tailored to your specific needs and conducted at the end of the build process. Additionally, we create custom videos to walk you through your new platform, ready for you to refer to as and when you wish.

### What is a CMS?

A content management system (CMS) is a software application which allows users to create, modify and publish content on
a website, without any specialised technical knowledge. If a CMS is custom – as opposed to open-source, like Wordpress,
or SaaS, like Wix or Shopify – it has been built specifically to the user’s requirements, taking into consideration the
unique functionality and design of their website.

### Why are they important?

CMSs allow businesses to create, edit and publish content online to a website or blog. They play a crucial role in the
online copywriting space. Below are a few reasons:

* **No coding knowledge needed** - By using a CMS you no longer require a web developer to change and modify content, so
  you can customise everything yourself.
* **Quick deployment** - Draft, edit and publish content pieces with the press of a button, which reduces turn around
  times for content publication.
* **SEO-friendliness** - Many CMS platforms come with built-in SEO tools to optimise your content for search engines,
  helping you boost your rankings.
* **Marketing power house** - CMS platforms provide plugins that let you connect to your marketing tools to help lead
  generation & improve your social media presence.
* **Increased ROI** - Although the development of a CMS might be more investment in the short term, it pays in the long
  term as you're able to edit content freely.

### CMS vs static websites

The term 'static' means that the website is fixed and the content cannot be changed without developer intervention. On
the other hand, CMS platforms allow dynamic content creation and management. Static sites suit basic needs, but CMS
platforms are much better suited for businesses who need to post and edit content regularly. To find out more about
this, read our
article: [Custom CMS development – Is it right for your website?](https://ainsley.dev/insights/custom-cms-development/)

### Headless architecture

For projects that require a higher degree of flexibility and scalability, as well as delivery across various channels,
you might consider a headless CMS like [PayloadCMS](https://payloadcms.com/) or [Strapi](https://strapi.io/). Unlike
traditional CMSs where the backend and frontend are tightly
connected, [a headless CMS](https://www.storyblok.com/tp/headless-cms-explained) separates these two, allowing for
greater
flexibility in how and where the content is displayed.

Developers can use any technology or framework to build the frontend, retrieving content from the headless CMS via API
calls. This makes it ideal for multichannel content delivery across websites, mobile apps and IoT devices.

Ultimately, a headless CMS approach allows for a much more robust, secure and faster platform as decouples the front-end
presentation layer from the back-end content management system, enabling greater flexibility and scalability.
