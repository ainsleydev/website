### What is web design?

Web design is the process of creating great-looking, functional websites. It involves arranging strategic elements on a
page like copy, images, and more to deliver great user experience (UX). A well-made website not only captures visitors’
attention, but also ensures they can navigate the site easily to find what they’re looking for.

In order to carry out great web design, you need great web designers. That’s where we come in. We work with you to
understand what you do and what your goals are, so that we can create a fantastic website that shows you off in the best
light. Web designers use their skills and expertise to capture your brand’s identity in the design elements of the
website.

### Why is it important?

Your website is essentially your virtual shop window. It can help you form a good impression on potential customers,
effectively portray your brand’s voice, and build trust with your audience. Not to mention, Google loves a high-quality
website.

### Does web design affect SEO?

In a word: yes. Web design has a significant impact on SEO, and several design elements actually influence how search
engines rank your website. For example, site speed and user experience.

Search engines favour fast-loading websites as they provide a better user experience. By having a well-optimised website
design, you can improve page loading times which can positively affect your SEO ranking. Search engines also value
websites that offer great user experiences. With a strategic design, seamless navigation, and engaging content, your
readers will be left satisfied resulting in better search engine results.

Websites, like people, come in all shapes and sizes

### Mobile Responsive Web Design

In this day and age, it’s hard not to see someone with a phone in their hand. It’s therefore important for your website
to adapt seamlessly to different sized devices. Responsive web design means the elements on your website automatically
respond to the size of the screen it’s on. Whether that’s condensing the menu, stacking content, or creating unique
templates for each screen size.

Responsive web design offers a practical and flexible option for your users, in line with industry best practices.
Whether your user is viewing your website design on a computer, laptop, tablet, or smartphone, you can provide them with
a consistent experience across all browsers and devices. With over 55% of website traffic coming from mobile devices, it’s time to think about responsive web design.
