faqs:
  - question: Is bespoke or off-the-shelf right for my organisation?
    answer: Choosing between bespoke and off-the-shelf software depends on factors like budget, timeline, and specific needs. Bespoke offers tailored solutions but requires time and investment, while off-the-shelf provides quicker implementation at a lower cost but may require additional customization. To truly gain a competitive edge, bespoke software can maximize your ROI.
  - question: How much does it typically cost?
    answer: Software development cost depends on a lot of moving parts and can differ greatly from one project to another. Remember that each software project is different, especially if you have an original idea. We tailor our pricing to accommodate your budget while delivering the best possible outcome for your project.
  - question: How long does it take to build an application?
    answer: This entirely depends on your needs and the size of the project. A timeline is documented as part of a proposal.
  - question: How can we make changes?
    answer: One of the key benefits of custom software is its ability to be scaled and evolve alongside your business. Service level agreements (SLAs) can be implemented to ensure we continually monitor your new application and add any new features you see fit.
  - question: How can my software app scale?
    answer: We predominantly use serverless architecture in our build systems. Serverless architecture enables scalability by automatically managing the allocation of resources in response to demand. This means that as your application experiences increased traffic or workload, additional resources are provisioned dynamically to handle the load, ensuring seamless performance no matter how many users.
  - question: What technologies do you specialise in?
    answer: We specialise in GoLang for back-end services, AWS-backed cloud operations, and SvelteKit as our front-end framework. While we feel this is the most performant stack, we are adaptable to incorporate other technologies based on your project's specific needs.
  - question: Do you test applications?
    answer: Yes, we rigorously test applications using various methods. Unit, contract, integration, and end-to-end testing are among the methodologies we employ to ensure your peace of mind when it comes to software quality and reliability.

### What is software development?

Software development is the design, documentation, programming, testing and on-going maintenance of software
applications. The software itself is a set of instructions that a computer or CPU (central processing unit) execute.
Software development can encompass planning, coding, debugging and deployment, which are all aimed at producing
high-quality software that meets the needs of users or businesses.

### The importance of software development

In this day and age, you can't walk far without seeing a device which runs on software. As technology continues to
advance and our reliance on it becomes greater, the demand for innovative software solutions will only grow,
highlighting the vital role of software development in today's modern world. A huge number of businesses rely on custom
software applications to power their day-to-day operations or streamline specific processes.

### Why go bespoke?

A custom software application tailored to your specific business requirements has the potential to streamline
operations, boost productivity and increase your return on investment (ROI). Off-the-shelf software might serve basic
needs, but to truly gain a competitive edge, more businesses are turning to custom software application development. To
find out more about the benefits of bespoke software and how it can help maximise your ROI, check out our blog
post: [Maximising ROI with custom software applications](https://ainsley.dev/insights/benefits-of-custom-software-applications/).

### Software development workflow

Below are the typical steps in the software development lifecycle.

- **Discover** - Envisaging and prioritising the project.
- **Plan** - Strategising the project's scope, timeline and resources.
- **Build & test** - Developing the software and rigorously testing it for quality assurance.
- **Deploy** - Rolling out of software to production environments.
- **Operate** - Monitoring and maintaining the software's performance and functionality.
- **Observe** - Gathering feedback and insights from users and system performance.

### Continuous integration & delivery (CI/CD)

Continuous integration & delivery (CI/CD) is a software development practice that involves automating and frequently
integrating code changes into a shared repository (CI) and deploying these changes into production (CD). Together, CI/CD
increases software development velocity, so that changes can be made quickly and easily, whilst maintaining high quality
and reliability.

### DevOps

DevOps combines development (dev) and operations (ops) to enhance the speed, efficiency and security of software
applications. It aims to shorten the development lifecycle by assisting programmers in manual processes, fostering
collaboration between teams and implementing automation and delivery practices.
