### What is content writing?

Content writing involves the careful creation of written material for various digital platforms. This includes blog
posts and articles, social media posts and website copy. The aim is to attract potential clients to your website using
high-quality, keyword optimised content that helps search engines, like Google, crawl your pages.

### Why is it important?

Content writing is crucial for establishing a strong online presence. Think of it as your brand's voice, handshake and
salesperson rolled into one. It's not just about being seen—it's about being remembered, trusted, and chosen. Engaging
content grabs your audience's attention and keeps them on your website, exploring and connecting with your brand.

### Does it affect SEO?

Absolutely. High-quality, keyword-rich content is essential for SEO. It helps search engines understand what your
website is about and improves your ranking on search engine results pages (SERPs).
